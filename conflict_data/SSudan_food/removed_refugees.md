South Sudan simulation.

The number of South Sudanese refugees arrived to neighbouring camps prior to the start of our simulation (15th of December 2013). In total 92611 refugees registered in Kakuma(45239), Pugnido(42044), Rhino(5313) and Kiryandongo(15) camps, which we deducted from source data files of each given camp (and from the total number of refugees). We saved all source data files in its original in the base_source_data directory.
